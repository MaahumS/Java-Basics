# Java Fundamentals

This repository showcases beginner-level Java programs written as part of academic coursework and work as an OOP tutor where I conducted hands-on coding demonstrations. 

## Concepts Covered:
- handling user input with `JOptionPane` and `Scanner`
- Parsing (converting data types)
- `while` `do-while` and `for` loops
- if-else and nested if structures
- switch structures
- acummulators
- methods
- output formatting with `system.out.printf` and `system.out.println`

### ðŸ“‚ Projects Included

#### 1. Credit Card Payment Simulator (`SattarM_J3ASP25.java`)
Simulates monthly credit card payments by calculating interest and principal until the balance is paid off. The user enters the initial balance and interest rate. The program displays a payment schedule, showing how much of each payment goes toward interest and principal.

---

#### 2. Paint Estimator (`SattarM_J3BSP25.java`)
Estimates how many gallons of paint are needed based on the dimensions of multiple rooms. The user enters the length and width of each room. The total area is calculated and divided by the coverage rate to determine the required paint gallons needed.

---

#### 3. Used Car Sales Commission Calculator (`SattarM_J3CSP25.java`)
Calculates total sales and commission for a car salesperson. The user inputs the number of cars sold, price of each car, and the commission percentage. Totals and formatted sales details are displayed.

---

#### 4. Income Statement Generator (`SattarM_J4BSP25.java`)
Builds a simple income statement by prompting the user for revenue and expense items. The program uses two separate value-returning methods to collect and calculate total revenue and expenses, then computes net income.

---

#### 5. Rewards Points Calculator (`SattarM_J2BSP25.java`)
Prompts user for their total expenditure and uses a nested if-else structure to determine rewards points awarder to customer.

---

#### 6. Shipping Cost Calculator (`SattarM_J2CSP25.java`)
Takes a purchase amount and shipping type from the user and calculates sales tax and total cost using a switch structure based on shipping location. Tax rates, owerweight charges and total cost are calculated based on initial shipping type entered.

Each program is a standalone `.java` file and can be compiled and run using the following:

```bash
javac FileName.java
java ClassName
